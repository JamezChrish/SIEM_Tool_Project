# Elastic SIEM Home Lab  

This project is a comprehensive guide to setting up and testing a **home lab** for **Elastic SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** integration using a **Kali Linux Virtual Machine (VM)**. The lab focuses on cybersecurity monitoring, threat simulation, and real-time alerting, providing a hands-on learning experience for security analysts, enthusiasts, and beginners in the field.  

## Project Highlights  

- **Iterative Development Model**:  
  The project follows an incremental approach, refining configurations and functionality through multiple iterations.  

- **Functional Features**:  
  - Log collection and forwarding from Kali Linux VM to Elastic Cloud.  
  - Real-time event analysis and monitoring using Elastic SIEM tools.  
  - Customizable dashboards and alerts for actionable insights.  

- **Non-Functional Features**:  
  - **Performance**: Handles real-time log ingestion and analysis.  
  - **Scalability**: Configured for expansion with additional data sources and workloads.  
  - **Usability**: Accessible setup for users with varying technical expertise.  
  - **Security**: Ensures secure log transport and robust configurations.  

## Technical Overview  

- **System Architecture**:  
  A centralized data collection model using Elastic Agent to forward logs from the Kali Linux VM to Elasticsearch indices stored in Elastic Cloud.  

- **Implementation Details**:  
  - **Languages and Tools**: Bash scripting, Elastic Agent, Nmap, Kibana, and Elasticsearch.  
  - **Core Modules**:  
    - Elastic Agent installation and configuration.  
    - Nmap-based threat simulation to generate security events.  
    - Querying logs and creating dynamic dashboards in Kibana.  

- **Testing Methodologies**:  
  - **Unit Testing**: Individual component testing (e.g., log ingestion, encryption).  
  - **System Testing**: Validation of integrated functions like monitoring, alerting, and dashboards.  
  - **Bug Fixes**: Addressed configuration mismatches, detection thresholds, and log ingestion delays.  

## Key Deliverables  

1. Detailed guide for setting up the Elastic SIEM home lab.  
2. Configured Elastic SIEM to collect and analyze logs from Kali Linux VM.  
3. Step-by-step walkthrough for integrating Elastic Agent and generating security events with Nmap.  
4. User manuals and troubleshooting guides for ease of replication and use.  

## Future Enhancements  

- Advanced integrations with additional tools like Snort or Suricata for enhanced threat detection.  
- Enterprise-level scalability for larger datasets and environments.  
- Automation of configurations using Docker or other orchestration tools.  

## Conclusion  

This project demonstrates a practical and accessible approach to leveraging Elastic SIEM for cybersecurity monitoring and threat analysis. It is designed to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and hands-on implementation, empowering users to explore the capabilities of SIEM tools in a controlled environment.
